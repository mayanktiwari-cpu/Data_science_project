## Project Overview 
Automatidata team to build a multiple linear regression model to predict taxi
fares using existing data that was collected by the team.Build a multiple linear regression model. In this scenario, the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) has approached the data consulting firm Automatidata to develop an app that enables TLC riders to estimate the taxi fares in advance of their ride.
## Objective 
The goal is to build a multiple linear regression model and evaluate the model. It includes:

1. Conduct a complete exploratory data analysis.
2. Perform any data cleaning and data analysis steps to understand unusual variables (e.g., outliers).
3. Use descriptive statistics to learn more about the data.
4. Create and run a regression model

 ## Data set 
 The data set has 22699 rows and 18 columns describe various features. 
 
 ## Exploratory Data Analytics 
As a result of the conducted exploratory data analysis, the Automatidata data team considered trip distance and total amount as key variables to depict a taxi cab ride. The provided scatter plot shows the relationship between the two variables. This scatter plot was created in Tableau to enhance the provided visualization.
