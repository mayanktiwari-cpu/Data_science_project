# Data_science_project
A collection of data science projects demonstrating real-world applications of analytics and machine learning.Data science portfolio: EDA, visualization, ML models, and insights.

## Objective of the project:
The project aimed to solve a real-world problem using data science techniques by analyzing large datasets, building predictive models, and generating actionable insights to support informed decision-making.

## Problem Statement:
Focused on different business problems. The goal was to provide accurate predictions and uncover meaningful patterns. 

## Preprocessing: 

- Handled missing values
- Removed duplicates
- Standardized features
- Engineered new variables for better model performance.

## Methodology:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identified trends, correlations, and data distribution.


2. **Feature Engineering:** Created relevant features to improve model accuracy.


3. **Model Development:** Implemented and compared multiple machine learning models (e.g. Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost ).


4. Evaluation: Selected the best-performing model using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, or RMSE depending on the problem type.


5. Visualization & Reporting: Presented results through graphs, dashboards, and reports for stakeholder understanding.
