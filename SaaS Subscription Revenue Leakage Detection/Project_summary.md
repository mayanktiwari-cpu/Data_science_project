# SaaS Subscription Revenue Leakage Analysis

## 📌 Overview
This project investigates **revenue leakage** in a mid-sized SaaS company with tiered subscription plans (Basic, Pro, Premium). Despite growth in users and product usage, actual revenue lags behind expectations. The notebook provides a **data-driven framework** to detect, quantify, and address leakage.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Identify mismatches between subscription status, usage, and payments.
- Quantify leakage by:
  - Plan type
  - Geography
  - Payment method
  - Customer segment
- Differentiate true churn from hidden leakage.
- Flag high-risk accounts for proactive recovery.
- Provide actionable insights to improve **revenue realization** and **customer retention**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python** (JupyterNoteBook)
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas` – data manipulation
  - `sqlalchemy` – database queries
  - `matplotlib` / `seaborn` – visualization
  - Additional packages for analytics and reporting
