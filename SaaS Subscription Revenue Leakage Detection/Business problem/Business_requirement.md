# Business Problem Overview
A mid-sized SaaS subscription company offers tier-based plans (Basic, Pro, Premium) with monthly and annual billing. The company relies heavily on recurring revenue through auto-renewals and digital payment methods.Despite steady growth in user acquisition and product usage, the finance team has observed a gap between expected subscription revenue and actual collections. Monthly revenue reports show inconsistencies that cannot be fully explained by customer churn alone.

Preliminary investigations indicate that the company is experiencing subscription revenue leakage, where users continue to access paid features without corresponding successful billing.

## 🚨 Business Challenges
The revenue leakage is driven by multiple operational and system-level issues:
* Active subscriptions without successful payment
* Users consuming services after failed payment
* Downgraded plans still billed at higher price
* Free trial users converting usage but not billing
* Failure rate by payment method
* Revenue stuck in “Pending” state
* Downgraded + old billing

## 🎯 Business Impact
Revenue leakage directly affects the company’s bottom line and operational efficiency:
- Estimated 5–15% monthly recurring revenue (MRR) is at risk
- High-value users remain active without successful payment
- Finance and operations teams lack visibility into where and why revenue is leaking
- Recovery efforts are reactive instead of proactive
- Without a data-driven solution, the leakage will scale alongside user growth, compounding revenue loss over time.

## 🎯 Objective of the Analytics Initiative

The company aims to build a subscription revenue leakage analytics framework to:
- Identify mismatches between subscription status, usage, and payments
- Quantify revenue leakage by plan, geography, payment method, and customer segment
- Distinguish true churn from hidden revenue leakage
- Flag high-risk accounts for proactive recovery actions
- Provide actionable insights to improve revenue realization and retention

## 🧠 Expected Business Outcome
By implementing this analytics solution, the SaaS company expects to:
- Improve billing accuracy and revenue realization
- Reduce revenue leakage through early detection
- Enhance customer lifecycle management
- Enable data-driven decisions for pricing, payment retries, and customer communication
