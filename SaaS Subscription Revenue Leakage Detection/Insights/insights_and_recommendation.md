# Business Insights

## Key Business Insights

### 21% of Expected Revenue Is Not Being Collected

₹5.836M in revenue is leaking despite active subscriptions, directly impacting topline growth.

### Customers Are Using the Product Without Paying

1,386 active users continue to consume services after payment failure or delay.

### Hidden Revenue Loss Is Larger Than Reported Churn

Revenue leakage from active users exceeds losses from cancelled or expired subscriptions.

### Payment Failures Are a Structural Revenue Risk

Gateway errors, insufficient funds, and timeouts are systemic—not isolated—issues.

### Card Payments Are the Biggest Bottleneck

Cards show the lowest success rates, driven primarily by timeout failures.

### Gateway Errors Have the Highest Financial Impact

₹9.21M is lost due to gateway-related failures alone among active users.

### ₹1.45M Is Stuck in Pending Payments

This is near-term, recoverable revenue requiring immediate executive attention.

### UPI and Wallets Are High-Performing Channels

These methods deliver ~80% success rates and should be strategically encouraged.

### Enterprise Customers Are Disengaging at a Higher Rate

The Enterprise segment has the highest inactive users and declining product usage.

### Geographic Concentration of Leakage Increases Risk

The USA is the largest contributor to leakage, primarily through card gateway failures.

### High-Value Plans Are Most Exposed

The Pro plan alone accounts for 40% of total revenue leakage.

### Renewal Revenue Is at Serious Risk

₹4.09 in monthly recurring revenue is exposed due to failed renewal payments.

### A Small Group of Users Drives Disproportionate Loss

Repeat payment failures by a limited set of accounts create outsized revenue risk.

### Billing and Subscription Systems Are Misaligned

Plan downgrades, trials, and usage controls are not fully synchronized with billing.

### Current Controls Allow Revenue Leakage to Persist

Lack of enforcement between payment status and service access enables ongoing loss.
